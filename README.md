# MLE Match Data Recorder

Records match data (teams, KO, etc) during play and saves a .json file with all rounds for that

### Build .op

1. create a new directory for convenience
2. copy in:
  - `info.toml`
  - everything in `./src/`
3. this folder should have info.toml and .as files in it's root.
4. select all in folder.
5. create a zip from these files
  - (**windows**) select all and right click > show more options > send to > compressed (zipped) folder
6. name this new zip file `mle-match-data-recorder.op` (change extension from .zip to .op)
7. done
